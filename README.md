## About
This repository contains the code and resources for our Deep learning project.

## Model Notebook
The notebook we used on kaggle to train the model and evaluate the metrics can be found in the `model_notebook` directory.
By uploading this notebook to kaggle and loading the EUVP dataset in the inputs, you should be able to run it. Training the model took 10h15 with the NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerator. 
Trained weights can be downloaded here: https://we.tl/t-u1H5ydvrcZ (wetransfer link)

Please refer to the notebook for details on the model implementation, training process, and evaluation metrics.
